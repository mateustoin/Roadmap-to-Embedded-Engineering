# Roadmap to Embedded Engineering

This repository should serve as a guide to everybody who wants to study software and hardware for embedded systems but doesn't know where to start.

## Motivation

Maybe some undergratuate students who wants to study and work with embedded systems have found some difficulty to know what to study. Many are used to work with Arduino, which is a good start, but when it comes to make prototypes and projects more like real world projects, making hardware and software more professional, it's hard to know the best way to do it.

I notice the problem when I started to look for internships and Jr. jobs. The companies are always asking for knowledge that the university doesn't teach usually. Of course, if you are a Computer Engineering student or some course related, you'll have a strong base to work   in this area. But this isn't enough.

To work serious with embedded systems, some preparation is necessary, in order to achieve the knowledge needed to work with both universes: **software and hardware**.

> **Nota para quem não fala inglês:** Um dos principais requisitos exigidos na maioria dos cargos oferecidos na área é um conhecimento em inglês suficientemente bom para falar e escrever, no mínimo. Por este motivo o repositório e tudo que for escrito será em inglês, não só para incentivar a leitura e aumentar o alcance dos temas abordados, mas também para que eu mesmo pratique a escrita dia após dia.

> **Note to non english speakers:** One of the main requisites that are required in jobs and internships is english. At least you need to speak and write. That's the reason this repository is being written in english, not only to increase reach, but for me either to train english everyday.

## Goals

The main goal here is to study most of the things needed to work with embedded engineering. With a lot of research I've done a collection of subjects that we need to know. Based on what professionals in the field says and what internships and junior jobs asks, we'll study the main topics in order to be prepared.

### How will this works

We are going to explore two main subjects: **software** and **hardware**. This repository structure will be divided in directories, which every one will have their own *README* with links to access **courses, indications of books, articles and examples of the exercises** that I'll do and document.

This repository should be updated a lot, in order to give you the best way to learn all of the subjects that will be learned.

### Some study subjects

I'll list some fo the topics that we will see and explain in this repository.

+ **Software**
  + Programming languages (basic and advanced subjects)
    + **C/C++**, Python/Micropython, Java, Rust
  + Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
  + Data Structure
  + Algorithms
  + Bare-metal programming
  + RTOS Knowledge (Real-time operating systems)
  + OS programming (Linux)
  + Linux OS practical usage
  + Bits manipulation
  + DIP (Digital Image Processing)
  + DSP (Digital Signal Processing)
  + Database technologies
  + Native android development with Java and C++ (NDK)

+ **Hardware**
  + Digital Logic
  + Hardware architecture (Arduino MCU among others)
  + Core (CPU, Registers, Bus, Cache, Flash/SRAM/DRAM memories)
  + Features and peripherals (GPIO, PWM, Clock, Watchdog, ADC, DMA, EEPROM, RTC, etc)
  + Protocols (UART, I²C, SPI)
  + Understand WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee and others
  + Interrupters, Timers, Counters
  + Microcontrollers interface (e.g AVR Programming or Arm Cortex)
  + PCB Design
  + Datasheet reading
